# Salon Scheduling System

A simple salon scheduling (appointment management) system-- a project for the class "Business Applications Development." Built using Python, Django, Bootstrap, and MySQL. The main value that the project delivers is that it allows the customers to schedule their appointment in advance, especially since this app was made during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.
